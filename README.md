# RLS-CodeSnippets
A collection of code snippets that can be used in Xcode.

# Support
swift2.0+
Xcode7.2+

## Installation
Run `install.bash`
If you already have files that have the same name in "~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets", 
a confirmation message to overwrite will be displayed for each file.  
If you don't need any confirmation, please run the script with argument `-f`.

## Uninstallation
Delete files in "~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets".  
If a file in this directory has a hex string for a name, then it was likely added or edited by you, so please confirm that it is a file that you actually want to delete.

## Usage
When you open [View]->[Utilities]->[Show Code Snippet Library], you will see snippets with [RLSã€œ] prefix.
You can use them by dragging and dropping them into your source code.

Alternativaly, they will be displayed as input completion.

Snippets for short syntaxes (ex. `guard let`, `for in` and so on) will be shown as input completion.  
Meanwhile, when you want to use some relatively long fixed phrases (using userdefaults, making singleton classes, and so on), you can see a list of candidates by typing `rls`.

Candidates will be shown in appropriate scope.
For example, you can use `enum` everywhere, but `guard` can be used only in methods.


## Tips
You can easily add snippets to your Xcode.  
All you have to do is select some code, then drag and drop it into the snippet list in Xcode's sidebar.   
After adding, snippets can easily be edited by right clicking and selecting [edit].

**Enjoy your Swift life!!**
